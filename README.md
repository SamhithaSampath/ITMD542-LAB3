## Insights and Results

### Insights:
During the development of this contact management application, I gained insights into the following key aspects:
- **Express.js Routing**: Understanding and implementing routing in Express.js for managing different views and actions.
- **Form Validation**: Implementing client-side form validation using regular expressions to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizing sqlite3 as a data store for contact information.

### Results:
- **Successful CRUD Operations**: The application allows users to successfully perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contacts.
- **Validation Feedback**: Implemented client-side form validation provides users with immediate feedback on the correctness of their input.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and manage contacts.

### Challenges Faced:
- **Date Formatting**: Achieving distinct date and time formatting for the "Date Created" and "Date Updated" fields presented a challenge. Resolving this required adjustments in the backend logic.
